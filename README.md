# uPhotoPageV1.0
Utilized html, css, mySQL with node.js in goormIDE to create a simple web page that tracks and allows users to "join" the website. Will store the new user e-mail. Used node package Faker.js to pre-generate 500 random user emails and date creation times as a test database.
mysql-test folder contains a simulated schema of a standard instagram-like app, and node_and_mysql contains Faker.js code to pre-generate 500 random user emails.
