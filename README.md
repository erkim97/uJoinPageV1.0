# uPhotoPageV1.0
Utilized html, css, mySQL with node.js in goormIDE to create a simple web page that tracks and allows users to "join" the website. Used node package Faker.js to pre-generate 500 random user emails' and date creation times as a test database.

1. Navigate into JoinUs folder
2. Type into terminal: node app.js, if running properly should say 'App listening on port 3000'
3. Open url link: https://joinuswebappsql.run.goorm.io/
